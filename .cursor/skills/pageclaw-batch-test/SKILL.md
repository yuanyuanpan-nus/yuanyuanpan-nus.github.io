# Pageclaw Batch -- End-to-End Test

Run the full `pageclaw-batch` pipeline on bundled fixtures and produce a test report.

## Fixtures

- **Style matrix:** `skills/pageclaw-batch-test/fixtures/style-matrix-test.yaml`
- **Page-story:** `skills/pageclaw-test/fixtures/page-story-test.md` (shared with pageclaw-test)

Read both files at the start. These are the only inputs for the entire test run.

## Execution

1. **Override output directory.** All pageclaw-batch output must go to `test-output/batch/` instead of the default `output/`. Before invoking pageclaw-batch, create `test-output/batch/html/` and `test-output/batch/docs/`. When pageclaw-batch references `output/`, substitute `test-output/batch/` throughout.

2. **Invoke pageclaw-batch** with the test style matrix and the shared page-story. Run in autonomous mode -- do not wait for user confirmation at the summary table. The matrix contains 3 styles; expect 3 combinations.

3. **Do not ask the user any questions** during the run. If pageclaw-batch would normally ask for confirmation, proceed automatically.

## Validation

After the batch pipeline completes, run these checks against `test-output/batch/`.

### Pipeline checks

- Pre-flight: style matrix parsed, page-story found, output dirs created.
- Parse Inputs: 3 styles detected, 1 page-story, 3 combinations listed.
- Each style (`01-sidebar-brutalist`, `02-col-whitespace`, `03-topnav-editorial`): all steps A-E completed without error.
- Master Index: `test-output/batch/index.html` generated.

### Artifact checks (repeat for each style `<id>`)

- `test-output/batch/docs/<id>-design.md` exists, contains `## Design Context` and `## Design System`.
- `test-output/batch/docs/<id>-impl.md` exists, contains a task-by-task plan.
- `test-output/batch/html/<id>.html` exists, is valid HTML (has `<!DOCTYPE html>` or `<html`).
- HTML uses CSS custom properties (`--bg`, `--fg`, `--accent`, etc. per Technical Contract).
- HTML has a light/dark mode toggle with `[data-theme="dark"]` override block.
- HTML is responsive (no fixed widths exceeding `100vw`).
- Zero raw hex/rgb values outside `:root` and `[data-theme="dark"]` blocks.
- Layout structure matches the style matrix `layout` field.
- Design intent from the style matrix is reflected in the visual output.

### Master index checks

- `test-output/batch/index.html` exists.
- Contains links to all 3 generated HTML files.
- Has its own light/dark mode toggle.

## Test Report

Print the following report after validation:

## Pageclaw Batch Test Report

### Pipeline
- [ ] Pre-flight: passed / FAILED
- [ ] Parse Inputs: passed / FAILED
- [ ] Style 01-sidebar-brutalist: completed / FAILED
- [ ] Style 02-col-whitespace: completed / FAILED
- [ ] Style 03-topnav-editorial: completed / FAILED
- [ ] Master Index: generated / FAILED

### Artifact Checks
For each style <id>:
- [ ] output/docs/<id>-design.md exists and contains ## Design Context + ## Design System
- [ ] output/docs/<id>-impl.md exists and contains task-by-task plan
- [ ] output/html/<id>.html exists and is valid HTML
- [ ] HTML has CSS custom properties (--bg, --fg, --accent, etc.)
- [ ] HTML has light/dark mode toggle with [data-theme="dark"] block
- [ ] HTML is responsive (no fixed widths > 100vw)
- [ ] Zero raw hex/rgb outside :root and [data-theme="dark"]
- [ ] Layout matches style-matrix layout field
- [ ] Design intent reflected in visual output

### Master Index Check
- [ ] output/index.html exists
- [ ] Links to all generated HTML files
- [ ] Has light/dark mode toggle

### Violations
(list any issues, or "None")

### Notes
(observations about quality, timing, etc.)
```

Mark each item with a check (passed) or note the failure. After the report, open `test-output/batch/index.html` in the browser if possible.
